    \item \textbf{Solution:}
    If both \textsc{Increment} and \textsc{Decrement} operations were included
    in the $k$-bit counter, an amortized analysis of the cost of $n$ operations
    would cost as much as $\Theta(nk)$ time because we would no longer be able
    to consider each operation as a consecutive \textsc{Increment}, but rather
    as any combination of \textsc{Increment}s and \textsc{Decrement}s. Thus, in
    a worse-case scenario, it would be possible to alternate $n$ times between
    two operations which cost $O(k)$ each, resulting in a total cost of
    $\Theta(nk)$.
