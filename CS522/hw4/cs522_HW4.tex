    \item \textbf{Solution:}
    We can reduce the subgraph-isomorphisim problem to the Hamiltonian cycle
    problem. We simply take the graph $G$, for which we want to test for a
    Hamiltonian cycle, and produce a second graph $G'$, which has the same
    number of vertices $n$ as in $G$, and is a simple cycle between all $n$
    nodes. If we can show that $G$ is isomorphic to a subgraph (here, the entire
    graph) of $G'$ in polynomial time, we have also shown that $G$ has a
    Hamiltonian cycle in polynomial time. However, since we know the Hamiltonian
    cycle problem to be NP-complete, we have therefore showed that the
    subgraph-isomorphism problem is NP-complete as well.
