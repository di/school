Othello Game for Introductory Artificial Intelligence Classes

version 2.2
	New Features:
	* Implemented a custom Java Security Manager to prevent agents
	  from doing sneaky things like file I/O or spawning helper
	  threads.
	
	Bug Fixes:
	* Fixed a potential (but not observed) bug in the game engine
	  that could cause a weird state, possibly inducing zombie threads,
	  if an agent throws an uncaught exception in getMove(...).
	  
	API Changes:
	* None.

version 2.1
	New Features:
	* Agents can now incrementally set their best move so that
	  if they miss their deadline that is the move that will be chosen.
	
	Bug Fixes:
	* Fixed a bug that allowed zombie threads to stick around if an
	  agent missed its deadline.

    API Changes:
    * Nothing other than the addition of the new API calls for the
      incremental best move setting.  An example of this new API was
      added to the ExampleOthelloPlayer.

	New Features:
	* An Eclipse project for the code was created.
