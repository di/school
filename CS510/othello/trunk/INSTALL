Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   Simply run `make'.  This will create `othello.jar' in the `lib'
directory, a JavaDoc in the `doc' directory, and an `othello' script
to run the program in the current directory.  Additionally, a jar file
will be created in the `lib' directory for each directory in
`src/students/'.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   This program has been compiled and tested using both Blackdown and
Sun JDKs/JREs.  The `Makefile' defaults to using the commands `javac'
and `java' for compiling and running java code, respectively.  To use
alternative commands, you must edit the `Makefile'.
