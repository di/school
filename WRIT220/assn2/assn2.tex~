   \section{From \emph{My Remarkable Uncle}:}
   This essay provides a sympathetic view of the fall of E. P. Leacock in two different senses. In the author's childhood, E. P. is a revered, mysterious oddity--but as the author grows, he becomes more and more aware of his uncle's fa\c{c}ade. Interestingly, the author shows reverence rather than resent upon this realization, even though he seems to have swindled his own family as well. This reverence is somewhat echoed by his final `resting' place at the monastery. In a similar way, the story also shows E. P.'s fall from power on a much larger scale, and the difference between how the rest of society (barman, etc) versus his nephew reacts. It is a little hard to find the source of the author's lack of anger upon revelation, though.

   \section{From \emph{Goldberg as Artifact}:}
   The author's goal in this piece is to portray Goldberg as someone beyond a simple pizza pusher, an appearance which would be common to nearly everyone he interacted with, save his few pals. Here, we see Goldberg as a man who feels compelled to do more with his life, even though he has already succeeded, someone with girl problems, weight issues, etc. However, it remains a very light piece. Using the `artifact' of the neon sign as a vehicle for some kind of elevation of status, we see he is still the same person--dreaming up new inventions and looking for a wife.

   \section{From \emph{Reflections on Gandhi}:}
   Orwell's writings on Gandhi, similar to the previous piece on Goldberg, portray him not as an average `non-saint' would see him--as perfectly pious, without fault, a saint from youth to death. Such portrayal, while seeming to ground a saint or demi-god, at the same time can elevate our perspective. Gandhi was not born a saint, he was born a man, and in the choice between saint and man that we all have made, he uniquely chose the difficulties of being a saint.
