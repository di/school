NOTE: this does not work.

= What's Missing =

I had a hard time deciding how to represent transitions in my NDFA class, as my implementation from last time (which worked) wan't adaptable enough to allow me to use it again. Therefore I ended up writing most of my code again.

Because of that, the "joiner" class, which is the machinery that combines NDFA's, is not 100% there, mostly because I didn't know how to "shift" transitions when combining NDFA's.

I had some code in ply.py but when cleaning up to submit I rm'd it and it is no more. It didn't work though, and I'd rather have this in on time than be late and have some broken half-implemented compiler compiler. I know how it works, but I wanted to put more of my time into the byHand implementation as it was significantly more work.
