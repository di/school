THE SPOKEULATOR
March 13th, 2009

This project compiles the same as any other java project. You can likely run the untared files directly by typing:

   $> java Spokeulator

No additional modules are needed or included.

Please keep in mind that a wheel with only 16 spokes and 5 crosses (for example) doesn't really make sense and won't look pretty.

Thanks!
