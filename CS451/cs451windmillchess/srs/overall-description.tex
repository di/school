Chess has been one of the most widely known and competitive games since its creation centuries ago.  While the rules of
the game haven't changed, the people who play chess and the places chess is played have.  To keep the game popular and
convenient to play in this modern age, a digital successor to the original board game is required. 

\subsection{System Interfaces}
Windmill's chess software focuses on simplicity of design and ease of play.  Therefore there are no separate
client/server interfaces; it utilizes one universal client program to automatically connect players.

The Windmill client has a very simple interface leveraging Java’s Swing to provide a simple and enjoyable game of chess
across a standard network.  The interface provides all the functionality needed to connect to another client and play a
standard rules-compliant game of chess.

\subsection{Hardware Interface}
The chess client, because it’s running on Java and using standard libraries should run on any computer with an
up-to-date version of Sun’s JVM, a mouse, keyboard, and network interface for playing against remote clients.

\subsection{Product Functions}
Windmill’s chess software will provide the interface, graphics, and logic required to play a standard game of chess over
a network connection with another chess client.
