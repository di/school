Title slide
    Steal and edit from previous presentation.
    Maybe put target crosshairs where his eye should be? :)
    
OMG WORLD WILL END WITHOUT THIS problem slide
    NSA example(s)?

OMG WORLD WILL END WITHOUT THIS impact slide(s)
    Money, end of world, patriotism, etc.

OMG WORLD WILL END WITHOUT THIS solution slide(s)
    How we (help) solve this problem.

Other Issues (previous presentation; slide #4)
    What happens when someone starts a new web services without registering?
    You don't know if every service is secure
    We want more aggregate information about web services on our network

Alternate/NearSame projects / How original is the project's idea?
    Previous presentation, slide 7
    Why don't these do the job?
    Wireshark -- Brief example of doing the FIRST DEMO EXAMPLE in Wireshark
    Snort -- Brief example of doing the FIRST DEMO EXAMPLE in Snort (possible?)

DEMO!
    example 1 -- compare it to Wireshark/Snort and why this is easier
    example 2 -- Show which services appear to call other services?  Nested
                 stuff
    example 3 -- UDDI registry exporting?  Grab WSDL from .Net servers?
    etc.

Was the project carried out efficiently? / Was the project technically
challenging?

Did the team address the societal impact of their project?

Software Development Tools
    Git, Nose, **bug tracking?**, TeX(?), auto-format(?)
    What did we use and why did we choose them?  Why didn't we use a bug
    tracker?  Address it up front so it's not asked later (hopefully).
    Something maybe like, "We worked with a tool model of using what was needed
    instead of pre-building a lot of structure around us that could limit our
    work instead of help it.  We didn't ever feel the need to have bug tracking
    software, so we didn't spend resources setting one up and using it.  Email
    and **social media and instant messaging** worked fine (maybe explain how
    text messages, Twitter messages, IMs, and chat rooms all we used in our
    development process).
    Describing how "new tools that don't fit previous models" helped us on our
    project is something I think a lot of the forward thinkers will like.

Testing Strategy
    Nose:  code coverage, branch coverage, etc.
    Generate these slides as far to the end as possible so we can get more
    tests done.  Just need to have a placeholder for now, as possibly describe
    our testing model (TDD we weren't, but how did we test?)

Requirements / Was the product well-specified? -- completely details the user's
expectation of the product.
    Hh'oh boy.

Design
    UML class layout
    UML/Tiks

Was an appropriate architecture selected?
The design completely details the architecture of the product.  The design
completely includes UML diagrams as well as other illustrations with full
granularity and with a formal way to trace the design features back to the
requirements document.
    (see "Design" above -- combine?)
    UML class layouts:  Need to make or update from design document.  Have
                        interfaces!
    Design:  Previous presentation; slides 27-31
    Extensibility:  Previous presentation; slide 32
    Python choice:  Previous presentation; slide 33

Were alternative designs considered?
Alternate designs were explained in significant detail with the pros and cons
of the design completely explained.
    What to put here?  Python vs. C?  PCAP vs NIDS?

Was the project carried out efficiently?
    Anything here?  Do we want to outline some design problems we had, but let
    them be small so it looks good?  Like how we started with PCAP but moved to
    NIDS, how we started with sockets but moved to queues, etc.?
